Random wanderer from the United States, professor of Statistics and Data Science at [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics/People/Dr-Joshua-Loftus).

On a good day outside of work I am exercising, learning (especially about physics or social sciences), exploring new places and cuisines, and discussing ideas.

I think technology, institutions, and ideas should serve people, but much of humanity is stuck with this upside-down. How can we change that?
