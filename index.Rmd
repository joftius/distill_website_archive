Random wanderer from the United States, former homeschooler, and current professor of statistics at the London School of Economics.

I love learning, especially about physics and social sciences. I'm happiest when exploring new places with a friend, talking about ideas, and eating authentic or unusual foods.

Technology, institutions, and ideas should serve people. But much of humanity is stuck with this upside-down. I want to figure out how we can change that.
