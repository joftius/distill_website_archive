More information can be found on my Google Scholar profile page.\nCausal inference in fairness\nThis work approaches fair machine learning from a causal inference perspective, arguing that determining what is fair is a similar challenge to determining causality.\nPress\nSome of this work was covered in the New Scientist and 36Kr.\nPublications\nM. J. Kusner, C. Russell, J. R. Loftus, R. Silva. Making Decisions that Reduce Discriminatory Impact. International Conference on Machine Learning, 2019. [link]\nM. J. Kusner, J. R. Loftus, C. Russell, R. Silva. Counterfactual fairness. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2017. [link]\nC. Russell, M. J. Kusner, J. R. Loftus, R. Silva. When worlds collide: integrating different counterfactual assumptions in fairness. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2017. [link]\nJ. R. Loftus, C. Russell, M. J. Kusner, R. Silva. Causal reasoning for algorithmic fairness. Preprint.\nPost-selection inference\nThis work involves challenging mathematical and computational aspects of conducting inference after selection procedures with complicated underlying geometry. For example, this research enables significance testing after use of some of the most popular model selection procedures such as the lasso with regularization chosen by cross-validation, or forward stepwise with number of steps chosen by AIC or BIC. Often the resulting significance tests are slightly modified versions of the classical tests in regression analysis.\nSoftware\nI’m a co-author of the selectiveInference package on CRAN.\nPublications\nX. Tian, J. R. Loftus, J. E. Taylor. Selective inference with unknown variance via the square-root LASSO. Biometrika, 2018. [link]\nJ. E. Taylor, J. R. Loftus, and R. J. Tibshirani. Inference in adaptive regression via the Kac-Rice formula. Annals of Statistics, 2016. [link]\nJ. R. Loftus. Selective inference after cross-validation. Preprint.\nJ. R. Loftus and J. E. Taylor.

It’s a bundle of packages including blockbusters like ggplot2 and dplyr.\nThis list of recommended packages has a lot of great suggestions as well.\nThere are many great, free books for learning R in more depth than the R Basics one above, including books focusing on visualization, introductory statistics, text mining, and data science.\nInteresting data sets\nData in R packages is easy to access. Just install.packages(\"packagename\") (with quotes), then library(packagename) (without quotes), and read the package documentation for help. For example, the nycflights13 documentation describes 5 dataframes contained in that package, like the flights dataframe and the name and meaning of each variable it contains.\nIf a package is not available on CRAN (the central repository for R), but is instead only hosted on github, you may need to install the package devtools and use the command devtools::install_github(\"authorname/packagename\").\nFiveThiryEight is an R package with many interesting datasets from the data journalism site with the same name. There are several sports and politics datasets, one about which movies pass or fail the Bechdel test, one about hate crimes and income inequality, one about employment and earnings of recent college graduates by major, and so on. Check the documentation for a full list of datasets and how to use each one.\nGapminder is an R package with data including life expectancy and GDP per capita by country and year. This is the data shown in a famous TED talk by the late Hans Rosling.\nThe four packages described in this post on the RStudio blog: babynames, fueleconomy, nasaweather and nycflights13.\n\n\n\n",
