    "contents": "\nWhat is machine learning?\nThis week introduced some of the key conceptual themes in machine learning. Two simple examples illustrated different strategies for building more complex models:\nincreasing complexity of the function class, for example by allowing functions to fit flexibly/locally to different subsets of the data\nincreasing the dimension of predictors (while otherwise keeping the function class fixed)\nModel complexity relates to the bias-variance trade-off: more complexity typically results in lower bias and higher variance.\n\n\n\nIncreasing complexity also (essentially always) results in a lower mean-squared error if the MSE is calculated on the same dataset that was used to fit the model. But if the MSE is calculated on a different dataset this is no longer true, and more complexity may result in a larger MSE.\nWhy should we evaluate model fit (like MSE) on a different dataset than the one used to fit the model? First, if we evaluate it on the same dataset instead, then such an evaluation will always prefer greater complexity until the model fully saturates the data. In this case there was nothing gained from using a model–we have only created a map as large as the entire territory. Second, if our purpose in using a model is to describe some stable aspect of the world, then we would hope that such a model’s fit would not immediately fail if the time or context of the data collection is slightly different.\nSince these concepts are so central to machine learning we will return to them several times through the term and understand them through more examples and some mathematical derivations.\nSlides and notebooks\nSlides for first video\nNotebook for gapminder example\nNotebook for candy example\nSlides for last video (PDF)\nNotebook from seminar\n\n\n\n",

My knife now has 19 years on it; it’s carved several thousand oxen and the edge is as if I had just taken it from the sharpener. Those joints have gaps, and the knife’s edge no thickness, to put something infinitesimally thin in an empty space?! Effortless! It even allows the edge wander in with ample room to play. That is why, with 19 years on it, this knife’s edge is grindstone fresh.” - Butcher Ding, the Zhuangzi\n\nSlides, notebooks, exercises\nSlides for logistic regression lecture (PDF)\nSlides for SVM lecture (PDF)\nNotebook for seminar\n\n\n\n",
